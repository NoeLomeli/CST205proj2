This is a school project for my class CST205 in CSU Montery Bay.

The project's goal is to have a person stand in front of the webcam and have their picture taken. 
Once the picture is taken it is converted to grayscale and cropped so that only the face of the person fills the frame.
The cropped photographed is stored in a folder where it is to be selected and then compared against a database of other people's
cropped photos.  If the computer finds a photo that belongs to the person in the first photograph it will be displayed on the 
screen.
